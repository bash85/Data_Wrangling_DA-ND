Countries compete for Olympic medals differently - some send many athletes, while others focus on specific sports they're good at. When we look at how many medals each country wins compared to their number of athletes, we see that smaller nations like Jamaica and Hungary can be surprisingly successful by concentrating on their strengths rather than competing in everything.

In this Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project, I performed data wrangling using Python’s Pandas library to clean, transform, and analyze Olympic data from the 2024 Paris Games. The goal was to determine which countries performed best in specific sports and whether their strengths in those sports influenced the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals they won. By merging datasets, handling missing values, and applying statistical methods, I identified patterns—such as whether top-performing nations in a sport tended to win more gold medals compared to others. The findings provided insights into how sporting excellence translates to medal outcomes, helping to predict future trends in international competitions.
